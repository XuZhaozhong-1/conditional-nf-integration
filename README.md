# Conditional Normalizing Flows for Monte Carlo Integration

This repository studies a conditional normalizing-flow proposal for families
of multidimensional integrals,

\[
I(c)=\int_{[0,1]^d} f(x\mid c)\,dx.
\]

Instead of training a new sampler for every condition $c$, one model is
trained across a continuous condition domain and reused at held-out conditions.
The network does **not** replace the integrand or directly predict the answer.
It learns where to sample; ordinary importance weights retain the original
integrand in the estimator.

## Main idea: conditional marginals plus a copula

The proposal separates individual coordinate shapes from their dependence:

\[
q_\theta(x\mid c)
=c_\theta(u_1,\ldots,u_d\mid c)
 \prod_{i=1}^d q_{i,\theta}(x_i\mid c),
\qquad
u_i=F_{i,\theta}(x_i\mid c).
\]

- **Conditional marginals** learn how each coordinate changes with the
  condition. They use monotone cubic-Hermite spline maps on $[0,1]$.
- **The autoregressive copula** learns the remaining conditional dependence
  among the marginal rank coordinates $u_i$.
- **A defensive uniform mixture** preserves support throughout the unit
  hypercube and reduces the risk of missing regions assigned very little mass
  by the current flow.

For samples $x_n\sim r_\theta(\cdot\mid c)$, the final estimate is

\[
\widehat I_N(c)=\frac1N\sum_{n=1}^N
\frac{f(x_n\mid c)}{r_\theta(x_n\mid c)}.
\]

Thus the learned model controls variance, while the importance ratio corrects
for proposal mismatch. Training requires only evaluations of the unnormalized,
nonnegative integrand; it does not require exact target samples or known
integrals.

## Training workflow

The current workflow uses:

1. condition sampling across the training domain;
2. self-normalized importance-weighted target approximations;
3. conditional marginal learning;
4. autoregressive copula learning in marginal-rank coordinates;
5. repeated proposal/cache refreshes;
6. full-target importance-weighted KL refinement; and
7. optional chi-squared/weight-variance refinement, accepted only when
   held-out effective sample size improves.

Annealed intermediate targets help move from broad initial sampling toward a
sharp final integrand. Fresh evaluation samples are used for reported integral
estimates.

See [Methods and applications](docs/METHODS_AND_APPLICATIONS.md) for the full
mathematical and implementation description.

## Applications and validation

### Scattering-process integration

The conditional variable is the partonic center-of-mass energy
$c=\sqrt{\hat s}$. MadGraph supplies generated matrix elements, while
process-specific maps transform unit-hypercube coordinates into physical
phase-space momenta and Jacobians.

| Process | Dimension | Held-out ESS/N | Validation |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| $gg\to t\bar t$ | 2 | 0.981--0.998 | randomized Sobol |
| $gg\to t\bar tH$ | 5 | 0.959--0.987 | two independent NF/Sobol evaluations |
| $u\bar u\to W^+W^-\to e^+\nu_e\mu^-\bar\nu_\mu$ | 8 | 0.927--0.941 | randomized Sobol plus a higher-statistics check |
| fully decayed $gg\to t\bar tH$ | 20 | 0.885--0.941 | pointwise matrix element, Sobol, and refined MadEvent |

For the 8D benchmark, a provisional $2.30\sigma$ difference at 300 GeV was
retested with higher statistics. The result became a $0.18\sigma$ difference:

\[
\sigma_{\rm NF}=0.0529874\pm0.000013\ \mathrm{pb},\qquad
\sigma_{\rm Sobol}=0.0529849\pm0.0000031\ \mathrm{pb}.
\]

### Synthetic 32-dimensional stress test

The `sparse_wave_32` benchmark has a known unit integral and a strongly
dependent conditional autoregressive structure. One frozen conditional NF and
one fixed VEGAS setup were tested on the same 160 held-out conditions with
approximately one million evaluations per method and condition.

| Method | Mean estimate | Mean absolute error | Mean ESS/N | 95% coverage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| conditional NF | 0.999254 | 0.001367 | 0.5328 | 0.7875 |
| tested VEGAS configuration | 0.0000135 | 0.999987 | -- | 0.0000 |

The experiment shows that the learned autoregressive proposal represents the
narrow correlated target far better than this particular axis-adaptive VEGAS
configuration under the assigned budget. It is not a universal claim about
all VEGAS implementations. The NF coverage is also below the nominal 0.95,
exposing residual uncertainty calibration and rare-weight-tail issues.

## Scope and limitations

The current results establish numerical correctness and conditional reuse for
the tested benchmarks. They do not establish a universal event generator or an
end-to-end speedup for arbitrary calculations.

- Training cost is excluded from quoted online-only timing comparisons.
- Most evaluations reuse one trained checkpoint; they are not yet a systematic
  study over independently trained models.
- Scattering calculations are parton-level and leading order, with specialized
  phase-space maps and no hadronic PDFs in the generic process sweep.
- The present formulation assumes a nonnegative integrand and does not yet
  handle signed subtraction contributions at higher perturbative orders.
- The 32D experiment reveals undercoverage even though its aggregate point
  estimates are accurate.

The validated one-dimensional cubic inverse should not be modified except for
its existing safeguard on the physical interval $[0,1]$.
